   - **Image Upload Preview**: Users can preview the image they upload before submitting their proposal. This enhances the user experience by allowing users to confirm their selection.
   - **Dynamic ID Generation**: Each proposal is assigned a unique ID, which is used for tracking and validation purposes.

### 2. **Voting Page (`voting.html`):**
   - **Real-Time Voting**: Votes are counted in real-time as users click on the voting options. The results are displayed immediately.
   - **Comment Section**: Users can leave comments, which are dynamically added to the page without requiring a refresh. This allows for ongoing discussions around each proposal.

### 3. **JavaScript Files (`js/`):**
   - **`upload.js`**: Handles image uploads, previews, and form submission. Manages data storage using LocalStorage.
   - **`voting.js`**: Manages vote counting, comment submission, and user interactions within the voting page. The script ensures that all actions are reflected in the UI without requiring a page reload.
